                Proposal
                Application
                Mini-Notes

                Idea
A minimalist site that allows users to write , upload and store notes.

                Motivation
I canâ€™t for the life of me take proper notes,
I use the same notebooks for 3 classes and 
often I just write them in google docs.Its a bit of a bulky solution.
I think people would make use of a tool that lets you write, edit, 
organize and store information in a way that is intended for studying.
I am interesting in building something like this because 
I think I can use it to learn a lot about several technologies 
without being too overwhelmed.

Application
Users can login  and access their personal pages.
Users can make ,modify and delete pages at will.
In the pages there will be the ability to add notes and textboxes 
and drag them around the screen as they see fit.Saving will allow users
to return to the page in the future.
